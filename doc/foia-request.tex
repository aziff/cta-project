\section*{Request}
On October 7, 2015, we received the results FOIA request of one month of arrival times for the 171 and 172 busses for June 2015. The file contained the following elements: route number, bus ID, arrival timestamp, stop ID.

We would like to make the same request for March 2016. We are setting up to scrape the predictions data from the CTA API for all of March 2016. We would like to use the arrival time data to check that our algorithm for calculating arrival time from the predictions is accurate. Because the requests take a long time, we would like to submit the request early to ensure that we can receive the data as soon as April 1, if possible. Please advise if there are any questions. Thank you.
